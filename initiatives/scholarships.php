					<h1 class="page-header">Scholarships Transforms Lives</h1>
					<p class="featured-text">Scholarships are the number one reason a student chooses a law school. But the rising cost of law school is making it harder for our students&mdash;many of whom are already working full- or part-time&mdash;to continue their studies. To remain competitive and attract academically distinguished students, we need to increase the number and amount of our scholarships.</p>

					<p>For John Marshall to continue to offer an outstanding legal education to deserving students from our community, we need to increase the number and amount of our scholarships.</p>
					<p>Borrowing to pay for law school limits our graduates' career paths to those with salaries sufficient to pay off student loans. As a result, graduates shy away from public interest-sector positions, leaving a gaping hole in a practice area that provides a valuable service to our communities. In order for our graduates to realize their dreams without the straitjacket of loan repayment, we need to increase the number and amount of our scholarships.</p>

								<p class="feat-arrow-content">Only <span class="red serif gamma">60%</span> of our entering class is awarded scholarships.</p>

					<p>Scholarship support also helps our students have time for honors programs, student organizations, and giving back to the community through pro bono activities that can be very difficult or impossible to engage in while working long hours during law school. In order for our students to distinguish themselves and draw on the full spectrum of law school offerings, we need to increase the number and amount of our scholarships.</p>
					<p>Along with scholarship support, other student-related investments, such as internships and bar preparation courses enable you to have a direct and transformational impact on the lives of our students.</p>
