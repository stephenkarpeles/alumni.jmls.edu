					<p class="featured-text">Help support the experience-based training John Marshall students need to be practice ready from day one. By supporting our clinical programs, you can be part of the $3.5 million dollar pro-bono impact our students have on their community.</p>
					<p>John Marshall is the first school in the Midwest, and one of the few in the nation, to require clinical experience for graduation. This requirement builds upon the wide range of skills students learn in our #2-ranked Lawyering Skills Program.</p>

					<p>Clinical and externship experiences hone students' abilities to perform essential lawyering skills prior to graduation, offer them an assessment of necessary competencies, and help to ensure that our students graduate with the knowledge, skills, and experience employers demand most.</p>
					<p>These practical experiences have a profound effect on the student attorney as they deepen their understanding of the relationship between the law school doctrine and real-world client environments. Students learn in our clinics, while becoming advocates in our community.</p>
					<p>To earn the required credit hours, students choose from eight clinical opportunities, including: Business Enterprise Law Clinic, Domestic Violence Clinic, Fair Housing Legal Clinic, Institute for Conflict Resolution, International Human Rights Clinic, IP Patent Clinic, Pro Bono Clinic, and Veterans Legal Support Clinic.</p>
