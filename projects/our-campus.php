					<h1 class="page-header">Our Campus Transforms Lives</h1>
					<p class="featured-text">With your support of our campus, with its new courtrooms and new work environments, our students will have access to the first-class resources and real-world experiences that give them an edge in a competitive market.</p>
					<p>The buildings that house The John Marshall Law School were never built to be educational facilities. Over the years, the law school had been divided up as each new faculty office, classroom, and library carrel was carved out of a dwindling reserve of available space. In 1996, the law school purchased nine floors in the 321 South Plymouth Court building. Yet it was clear that more transformation was needed as the school leadership forecast the future needs of the school.</p>
					<p>It is easy to see the power of transformation at the corner of State St. and Jackson Boulevard. The building at 19 W. Jackson, along with our new Student Commons and entrance on State Street, as well as the state-of-the-art Arthur J. Goldberg Memorial Courtroom, reflect the law school's commitment to our students, our academic programs, our alumni, the city of Chicago, and the future of legal education.</p>
					<p>In addition to restoring an historic building, we were the first law school in the Midwest to design space to accommodate the needs of veterans struggling with PTSD. Our new Community Legal Clinics facility is getting well-deserved recognition for this innovative design, including a Chicago Vision Award from the Urban Land Institute.</p>
