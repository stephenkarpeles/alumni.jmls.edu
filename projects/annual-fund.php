					<h1 class="page-header">The Annual Fund Transforms Lives</h1>
					<p class="featured-text">The transformation happening at John Marshall comes with a cost. We rely heavily on tuition income, but that is not sufficient to do all that we need to do.  We need your support to carry on the deep and meaningful tradition of transforming lives here at The John Marshall Law School.</p>
					<p>The Annual Fund is the key source of support that impacts virtually everything at John Marshall. This critical source of funding directly benefits current students by supporting student financial aid, faculty and curriculum development, and facility improvements. </p>
					<p>The Annual Fund enables us to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to meet new challenges throughout the year. In fact, a $100 gift to the Annual Fund contributes as much to the law school's annual budget as a $2,000 endowed fund.</p>
					<p>Approximately 50% of our students receive law school grants and scholarships&mdash;funds that annual gifts help provide.</p>
					<p>Annual giving is so important that John Marshall created a giving society to honor its most loyal Annual Fund donors. Donors who have supported the Annual Fund for five or more consecutive years are recognized as members of the 1899 Society.  Consistent giving is the cornerstone of the Annual Fund's success.</p>
