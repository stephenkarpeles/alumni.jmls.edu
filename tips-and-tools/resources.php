					<h1 class="page-header">John Marshall Resources for Alumni</h1>
					<p class="featured-text">The following services and resources are available to John Marshall alumni while they&rsquo;re on campus.</p>
					<h3>Free LexisNexis &amp; Westlaw Access</h3>
					<p>The Library provides alumni with free access to LexisNexis Academic and an abridged version of Westlaw. LexisNexis Academic, if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar, is slightly different from the Lexis used by law students. While the search features and content are less extensive, users can still pull and Shepardize cases, run basic searches, etc. Alumni Westlaw access is very similar to what students use. All core content regarding cases, statutes, and Illinois practitioner materials are there. </p>
					<p>While on campus, a reference librarian would be happy to help you use these products. Free LexisNexis and Westlaw access is only available on site in the John Marshall Louis L. Biro Law Library.</p>
					<h3>Free WiFi</h3>
					<p>As an alum, you can use free wifi while on campus. Make the 7<sup>th</sup> Floor IT Help Desk your first stop to get an access code.</p>
					<h3>Transcript Requests</h3>
					<p>Need an official copy of your transcript? Contact the Registrar&rsquo;s Office to submit your request. More information is available on the <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/registrar/transcript-requests.php" class="bold">Registrar&rsquo;s transcript webpage</a>.</p>
