Ferencz chats with students before his presentation as the Dean Fred F. Herzog Memorial Lecture speaker. Ferencz served as the chief prosecutor for the U.S. Army in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the 12 military trials held at Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II.</p></div>
<p>Preventing aggressive war and creating peace among turmoil is possible. But it can’t be done without a properly enforced international justice system, according to the last surviving Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin B. Ferencz.</p>
<p>“I am sure that it is possible. I have seen the impossible happening, and so have some of you,” Ferencz told students and guests at the April 14, 2014, Dean Fred F. Herzog Memorial Lecture on human rights. “The emancipation of women, the end of colonialism, same-sex marriages, a black president – all of these things would have been impossible if you would have asked anybody 25 years ago, ‘Can it happen?’”</p>
<p>Ferencz discussed his experience as a U.S. prosecutor in post-World War II Germany and expressed his hopes for future generations to promote “law not war.” Ferencz was just 27 on his first case as a lawyer when as part of the Nuremberg Trials. He prosecuted 22 defendants accused of murdering more than a million people during the war.</p>
<p>“War is hell,” Ferencz said. “Nuremberg taught me that creating a world of tolerance and compassion would be a long and arduous task. I also learned that if we did not devote ourselves to developing effective world law, the same cruel mentality that made the Holocaust possible might one day destroy the entire human race.”</p>
<div id="attachment_13157" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://news.jmls.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MG_4862-small.jpg" rel="lightbox[13155]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13157" alt="Welcoming Ben Ferencz (second from left) to The John Marshall Law School are (from left) Professors Gerald Berendt, Mark Wojcik, Shahram Dana, Dean John E.

Corkery and DePaul University Professor Emeritus Cherif Bassiouni (LL.M. ’66).</p></div>
<p>Ferencz served in WWII under General George S. Patton. As Nazi atrocities were uncovered, he was transferred to the U.S. Army’s War Crimes Branch to gather evidence of Nazi brutality and apprehend criminals.</p>
<p>Ferencz is a staunch proponent of the International Criminal Court, saying: “We continue to go on with wars because the present system is very simple. If the two heads of state are unable to agree, they take a group of nice people and they send them off to kill another group of nice people. They don’t know these people and they are doing it for reasons they don’t understand. That’s the current system. It’s not common sense. If you have a disagreement with your neighbor, you don’t buy a gun.  You take them to court because that’s the humane and rational thing to do.”</p>
<p>Ferencz said that for thousands of years, the use of armed force has been hailed as the way to glory, power and heroism. Changing that practice and mindsets of the leaders behind it would be challenging, but not insurmountable, he said.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me anything possible is not possible. It’s possible. You have to put in the effort for it and never give up. Never give up, that’s my slogan,” Ferencz said.</p>
<p>“This is a law school. Imagine what the world would look like if instead of going to war, killing all these innocent people who had nothing to do with anything, you could find the rule of law instead and you could hold them in contempt instead of the glorification of war,” he added. “How the world would change if you just shifted around and said ‘law, not war.’”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The John Marshall Law School will present diplomas to 329 graduates at its 197th commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 18, 2014.</p>
<p>The law school will award 285 J.D., 33 LL.M. and 11 M.S. degrees at the 3 p.m. program at the Chicago Marriott Downtown.  The commencement speaker will be Illinois Appellate Court Justice Joy Cunningham and the law school will award an honorary degree to Harriet Seceley Hausman. The class valedictorian is Elizabeth Winkowski.</p>
<p>Justice Cunningham is a 1982 graduate of John Marshall.  A native of New York, she was a nurse before coming to law school.  She practiced law with the Illinois Attorney General’s Office and with a law firm before clerking for Illinois Appellate Court Justice Glenn T. Johnson.  In 1986, Cunningham served as associate general counsel for both the Loyola University Health System and Loyola University-Chicago.</p>
<p>In 1997, Cunningham was appointed an associate judge in the Circuit Court of Cook County. She served for three years before stepping down to assume the positions of senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary for Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She left the position in 2006 when she was elected to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District.</p>
<p>Hausman is being recognized for her continued support both of John Marshall students and the community at-large.  Her husband, Martin, was a 1937 graduate of the law school who founded Power Parts Inc., a business that made replacement parts for diesel engines. She worked alongside him, but she also got him involved in her personal causes, including working for civil rights, protesting the Vietnam War and protecting the Constitution’s guarantees for all peoples through her work with the American Civil Liberties Union. Hausman was elected to three terms on the River Forest Township board.</p>
<p>Although he never practiced law, Martin Hausman supported John Marshall throughout his career believing his legal education was important to his success.  When he died, his wife continued that support by establishing the Martin Hausman Scholarship in 1988. Today, her donations underwrite the Martin Hausman Award that helps cover the cost of bar prep courses.  In 2013, the Hausman Award assisted 33 students.</p>

<p>The volunteer efforts of more than 100 students who participated in The John Marshall Law School Pro Bono Program and Clinic over the past year were celebrated at an April 28, 2014, luncheon.</p>
<p>Guest speaker Marian Hatcher, project manager for the Women’s Justice Program of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, applauded the work of alumnus John Antia (J.D. ’13) and students -- Magdalena Wilk, Samantha Sims, Italia Lima and Amanda Bolhuis -- who drafted the “National Day of John’s Arrest Partners and Their Solicitation Laws” report for the Sheriff’s Office.  Hatcher said the work of these John Marshall students was invaluable. Their legal findings have been published and are used as the basis for the county’s initiative in establishing sting operations.</p>
<p>Hatcher told the students she was thrilled by the work students did on the project, and that she is “really proud to be partnering with this great institution, John Marshall.” During one’s career “you can grow and learn and be part of some really important work,” Hatcher said, while stressing that it is important to represent all peoples because “it takes people helping each other.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.jmls.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MG_0302-small.jpg" rel="lightbox[13149]"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13152" alt="Paul Kossof" src="http://news.jmls.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MG_0302-small-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a>When a business takes its global production and marketing to China, it needs to protect its reputation and brand name. Paul Kossof, a third-year student at The John Marshall Law School in Chicago, has set out to help businesses by writing the first book on China’s new trademark law which takes effect on May 1.</p>
<p>Kossof’s book, “Chinese Trademark Law: The New Chinese Trademark Law of 2014,” offers readers concise explanations and accompanying analysis for every amendment in China’s Third Revision of Trademark Law. Kossof also offers predictions on how the amendments will affect China’s trademark legal practice.</p>
<p>“The United States protected trademarks even before it became an independent nation. In comparison, China implemented its first trademark law in 1982,” said Kossof who, since graduating from Villanova University in 2011, has spent the equivalent of two years working in Beijing and Shanghai. A fluent Mandarin Chinese speaker, Kossof’s book analyzes each amendment, and includes amendment citations and versions of related laws and regulations in both English and Mandarin.</p>
<p>Kossof’s experience has given him perspective on how the new law will improve how companies conduct business in China. For example, Kossof says the new law will streamline the process for registering a trademark; increase six-fold the amount of statutory damages and allow punitive damages for trademark infringement; recognize sounds as trademarks; and prohibit holders of Chinese well-known trademarks from dominating the consumer market through unfair advertising.</p>
<p>Kossof thinks these are all good changes, but he knows there are multiple cultural differences in how Chinese and western governments operate. To ease the transition, his book provides insights on how to interact with the Chinese Trademark Office and Trademark Review and Adjudication Board. He also includes sample “cease and desist” letters, tips for negotiating with trademark squatters and the world’s first published English translation of the new law.</p>
<p>Kossof hadn’t intended to write a book, but John Marshall Professor Mark Wojcik encouraged him after reading Kossof’s numerous papers on the topic. One such article, “The New Chinese Trademark Law,” won Kossof the International Trademark Association’s 2014 Ladas Memorial Award, which honors excellence in trademark publications.</p>
<p>His next project, to be published in July, is “Chinese Legal Research,” a book that gives researchers the background, tools and tips needed to conduct effective Chinese legal research, even without basic knowledge of Mandarin. Kossof said it has been customary to hire a researcher or law firm in China to handle research, but this latest book details steps to make the process easy enough for foreign legal researchers.</p>
<p>Kossof will receive a J.D. degree with a certificate in Intellectual Property Law in May, and is expected to complete an LL.M. degree in International Business and Trade Law in January 2015. He is considering a range of job possibilities, and he is certain his future legal work will be in China.</p>

Wendt was Tsang’s supervising attorney during her three semesters with the agency.</p></div>
<p>Melinda Tsang, a third-year student at The John Marshall Law School, has assisted needy clients of Chicago’s Center for Disability &amp; Elder Law (CDEL) this semester thanks to the generosity of AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Tsang, who has focused on Elder Law while in law school, said being selected the AT&amp;T Pro Bono in Excellence Scholarship recipient helped her decide to continue working at CDEL. She had completed an externship and volunteered there for two semesters.</p>
<p>“I am so appreciative to have been selected for this honor,” Tsang said. “I enjoyed my time with the agency, and I learned so much that I was happy to get the opportunity to continue my <i>pro bono</i> efforts.”</p>
<p>Tsang was selected by the AT&amp;T Midwest Region Pro Bono Committee for the $2,500 award that was applied to her law school tuition. The award is meant to foster “a lasting commitment to pro bono service in the student’s future professional practice,” said John J. Reidy III, co-chair of the Pro Bono Committee.</p>
<p>Thomas C. Wendt, chief legal officer at CDEL, said Tsang has worked on a number of important cases for CDEL, and her past semesters of work made her an important member of the team.</p>
<p>After graduating from Bryn Mawr College and working as a paralegal, Tsang moved to Chicago for law school. She didn’t have a legal specialty in mind, but recognized Elder Law is an up-and-coming area of law, and after her time at CDEL, she found she enjoyed working with the clientele.</p>
<p>“Elder Law is much more than just preparing wills and trusts,” Tsang explained. “While there is a big shift among the elderly for advanced planning so that they can avoid legal problems as they age, the people I was assisting were dealing with debt collectors, landlords and other immediate issues. People facing those types of problems are really panicked thinking they’ll lose what little they have in resources and property.”</p>
<p>John Marshall offers J.D. students a <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/academics/elderlaw/jd-cert-elderlaw.php">certificate in Elder Law</a>. The program is one of the first in the nation specially designed to give attorneys knowledge of the intersection of elder rights and the law, including health care planning, financial planning and protections, conservatorship and guardianship and elder advocacy. Legal expertise gleaned through Elder Law courses and CDEL has allowed Tsang to explain complicated paperwork and offer clients advice on next steps.</p>
<p>“These clients are the ones who most need legal representation, but they don’t have the money to hire an attorney to help them,” she said. “They are so thankful when the Center’s staff is able to assure them that they won’t be going to jail or losing their possessions.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_13106" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://news.jmls.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MMK_9824.jpg" rel="lightbox[13105]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13106" alt="Michael Schlesinger (left), director of the Business Enterprise Law Clinic, works with student Jason Leigh on a project." src="http://news.jmls.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MMK_9824-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michael Schlesinger (left), director of the Business Enterprise Law Clinic, works with student Justin Leigh on a project.</p></div>
<p>Students at The John Marshall Law School can receive more hands-on experience than ever before, as the school introduces six new clinics to its list of those already respected in local and national legal communities. The expansion is part of John Marshall’s focus on providing law students with an enriching, skills-focused learning experience.</p>
<p>“It’s not enough for us to expect our students to listen and learn,” said Anthony Niedwiecki, associate dean for Skills, Experiential Learning &amp; Assessment. “We expect them to do, and to put that learning to the test before they step out of our doors.”</p>
<p>John Marshall’s newest clinics focus on: Business Enterprise Law, Conflict Resolution, Domestic Violence, International Human Rights, Intellectual Property and Pro Bono. They join John Marshall’s 20-year-old Fair Housing Legal Clinic, Patent Clinic and nationally renowned Veterans Legal Support Center &amp; Clinic. Work through the Patent Clinic now will fall under the new Intellectual Property Clinic, which will also include a Trademark track.</p>
<p>“My time in our clinics has taught me how to work with clients and courts, and has really tested what I learned in the classroom,” said third-year law student Marcos Resendiz, who has worked in John Marshall’s fair housing and veterans clinics. “I chose John Marshall in part because of its clinical work, and it’s exciting to see that my future fellow alums will have even more options to help our community.”</p>
<p>Expanding its clinics not only provides John Marshall students with meaningful law school experiences, but also increases the thousands of hours of legal work students return to Chicago, Niedwiecki said.</p>
<p>John Marshall recently instituted a three-credit graduation requirement mandating students partake in a clinical experience or an externship sometime during their last three semesters of law school. Students can combine experiences to meet the three-credit requirement. For example, a student may earn two credits from a clinical experience, and an additional hour or two from an externship in a law office or at a government agency.</p>
<p>Each credit requires four hours of weekly field work, meaning that each John Marshall student provides a minimum of 168 hours of work back to the community. With a full-time enrollment of about 300, John Marshall students perform more than 50,000 hours of legal work, before they even take the bar.</p>
<p>“John Marshall has always been a law school dedicated to service to our community,” Dean John E. Corkery said. “Our new clinics are further proof of our commitment to providing law students an experience that will make them employable, as well as helping those most in need.”</p>
<p>The experiential requirement builds upon John Marshall’s nationally recognized Lawyering Skills Program, ranked No. 2 in the nation by <i>US News and World Report’s Best Graduate Schools</i> for two years in a row. John Marshall is the only law school in the Midwest to mandate experiential learning in order to graduate, and leads the nation in the number of credits that students take in practice-based courses and hands-on experience.</p>

<p>Victoria Whiteside bested two third-year students from other law schools to win first place in the association’s Spring Essay Scholarship competition. She will receive $10,000 toward her legal education.</p>
<p>In her essay, Whiteside used facts provided for a fictitious case that was similar to the circumstances in the case of Trayvon Martin, the young man who was shot and killed in February 2012, in Florida. Accused shooter George Zimmerman used a “stand your ground” defense and was found not guilty after a July 2013 trial.</p>
<p>Whiteside presented arguments for the prosecution, in pursuit of an involuntary manslaughter charge. Whiteside, who is completing her Criminal Law class with Professor Kim Chanbonpin, said the competition gave her the opportunity to develop her critical thinking skills and that Chanbonpin challenged her to analyze the issues and to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>A graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a bachelor of science in Health Administration and Policy, Whiteside spent five years as a health care consultant servicing state and federal agencies throughout the United States. Her last position before law school was working in Washington, D.C., for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as it established the Health Care Insurance Exchange under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>After law school, Whiteside intends to focus her legal career on health care law.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Struggling Illinois homeowners could get new legal help thanks to a grant awarded by Illinois’ attorney general. The grant will enable law students from The John Marshall Law School, partnered with the Northside Housing Collaborative (NHC), to provide added legal assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure and new homebuyers in Chicago’s north side communities.</p>
<p>Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/northside-housing-collaborative-kickoff-press-conference-registration-9250682039" rel="nofollow">will join representatives from the NHC</a> and John Marshall to provide details on how the funding will help Illinois homeowners and buyers avert some of the practices that led to the state’s foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p>The Pro Bono Clinic at John Marshall, in collaboration with NHC, will provide expert legal assistance through pre-purchase education for homebuyers, foreclosure prevention information and employer-assisted housing, thanks to a two-year agreement with Madigan’s office.</p>
<p>The $800,000 grant to NHC comes from a national settlement (United States of America, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et. al) involving the nation’s five largest bank servicers that were cited for fraudulent practices while servicing loans of struggling homeowners. As part of the settlement, Madigan is now disbursing funds to mitigate the effects of Illinois’ widespread foreclosure problem. A portion of those funds has been allocated for pro bono work from John Marshall, to help troubled homeowners who are entering foreclosure, and pre-purchase homebuyers trying to avert predatory lenders.</p>
<p><strong>About the Northside Housing Collaborative</strong><br />
The nine-member Northside Housing Collaborative is a team-based program model, providing HUD-certified foreclosure and pre-purchase housing counseling. This collaborative program, to be funded by the Illinois Attorney General's National Settlement Grant, will be conducted at seven, culturally specific, nonprofit community service organizations on the north side of Chicago, including the following organizations and community locations:</p>
<p><strong>Albany Park     </strong><br />
Cambodian Association</p>
<p><strong>North Park</strong><br />
Korean American Community Services</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Park        </strong><br />
Northside Community Development Corporation</p>
<p><strong>Uptown</strong><br />
Bosnian-Herzegovinian American Community Ctr.<br />
Chinese Mutual Aid Association<br />
Laotian American Community Services</p>
<p><strong>West Ridge       </strong><br />
Indo-American Center</p>
<p><strong>About John Marshall’s Pro Bono Clinic</strong><br />
John Marshall encourages its students to participate in pro bono work to foster commitment to community service, both during law school and after graduation. By cultivating a culture of service, John Marshall’s pro bono clinic not only provides a valuable resource for clients in need, it also prepares students for a life of purposeful citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>EVENT DETAILS:</strong><br />
<strong>Who:</strong> Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Northside Housing Collaborative, The John Marshall Law School<br />
<strong>What:</strong> Announcement of grant for homebuyer education<br />
<strong>Where:</strong> Korean American Community Services, 4300 N. California Ave., Chicago, Ill.<br />
<strong>When:</strong> 10-11:30 a.m.; Madigan expected to speak at 10:30 a.m.; Wednesday, May 7, 2014</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a business takes its global production and marketing to China, it needs to protect its reputation and brand name. Paul Kossof, a third-year student at The John Marshall Law School in Chicago, has set out to help businesses by writing the first book on China’s new trademark law which takes effect on May 1.</p>
<p>Kossof’s book, “Chinese Trademark Law: The New Chinese Trademark Law of 2014,” offers readers concise explanations and accompanying analysis for every amendment in China’s Third Revision of Trademark Law. Kossof also offers predictions on how the amendments will affect China’s trademark legal practice.</p>
<p>“The United States protected trademarks even before it became an independent nation. In comparison, China implemented its first trademark law in 1982,” said Kossof who, since graduating from Villanova University in 2011, has spent the equivalent of two years working in Beijing and Shanghai. The book from Kossof – who is fluent in Mandarin -- analyzes each amendment, and includes amendment citations and versions of related laws and regulations in both English and Mandarin..</p>
<p>Kossof’s experience has given him perspective on how the new law will improve how companies conduct business in China. For example, Kossof says the new law will streamline the process for registering a trademark; increase six-fold the amount of statutory damages and allow punitive damages for trademark infringement; recognize sounds as trademarks; and prohibit holders of Chinese well-known trademarks from dominating the consumer market through unfair advertising.</p>
<p>Kossof thinks these are all good changes, but he knows there are multiple cultural differences in how Chinese and western governments operate. To ease the transition, his book provides insights on how to interact with the Chinese Trademark Office and Trademark Review and Adjudication Board. He also includes sample “cease and desist” letters, tips for negotiating with trademark squatters and the world’s first published English translation of the new law.</p>
<p>Kossof hadn’t intended to write a book, but John Marshall Professor Mark Wojcik encouraged him after reading Kossof’s numerous papers on the topic. One such article, “The New Chinese Trademark Law,” won Kossof the International Trademark Association’s 2014 Ladas Memorial Award, which honors excellence in trademark publications.</p>
<p>His next project, to be published in July, is “Chinese Legal Research,” a book that gives researchers the background, tools and tips needed to conduct effective Chinese legal research, even without basic knowledge of Mandarin. Kossof said it has been customary to hire a researcher or law firm in China to handle research, but this latest book details steps to make the process easy enough for foreign legal researchers.</p>
<p>Kossof will receive a J.D. degree with a certificate in Intellectual Property Law in May, and is expected to complete an LL.M. degree in International Business and Trade Law in January 2015. He is considering a range of job possibilities, and he is certain his future legal work will be in China.</p>
<p>To speak with Kossof or learn more about his book, please contact John Marshall Public Affairs Director Christine Kraly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students at The John Marshall Law School can receive more hands-on experience than ever before, as the school introduces six new clinics to its list of those already respected in local and national legal communities. The expansion is part of John Marshall’s focus on providing law students with an enriching, skills-focused learning experience.</p>
<p>“It’s not enough for us to expect our students to listen and learn,” said Anthony Niedwiecki, associate dean for Skills, Experiential Learning &amp; Assessment. “We expect them to do, and to put that learning to the test before they step out of our doors.”</p>
<p>John Marshall’s newest clinics focus on: Business Enterprise Law, Conflict Resolution, Domestic Violence, International Human Rights, Intellectual Property and Pro Bono. They join John Marshall’s 20-year-old Fair Housing Legal Clinic, Patent Clinic and nationally renowned Veterans Legal Support Center &amp; Clinic. Work through the Patent Clinic now will fall under the new Intellectual Property Clinic, which will also include a Trademark track.</p>
<p>“My time in our clinics has taught me how to work with clients and courts, and has really tested what I learned in the classroom,” said third-year law student Marcos Resendiz, who has worked in John Marshall’s fair housing and veterans clinics. “I chose John Marshall in part because of its clinical work, and it’s exciting to see that my future fellow alums will have even more options to help our community.”</p>
<p>Expanding its clinics not only provides John Marshall students with meaningful law school experiences, but also increases the thousands of hours of legal work students return to Chicago, Niedwiecki said.</p>
<p>John Marshall recently instituted a three-credit graduation requirement mandating students partake in a clinical experience or an externship sometime during their last three semesters of law school. Students can combine experiences to meet the three-credit requirement. For example, a student may earn two credits from a clinical experience, and an additional hour or two from an externship in a law office or at a government agency.</p>
<p>Each credit requires four hours of weekly field work, meaning that each John Marshall student provides a minimum of 168 hours of work back to the community. With a full-time enrollment of about 300, John Marshall students perform more than 50,000 hours of legal work, before they even take the bar.</p>
<p>“John Marshall has always been a law school dedicated to service to our community,” Dean John E. Corkery said. “Our new clinics are further proof of our commitment to providing law students an experience that will make them employable, as well as helping those most in need.”</p>
<p>The experiential requirement builds upon John Marshall’s nationally recognized Lawyering Skills Program, ranked No. 2 in the nation by <i>US News and World Report’s Best Graduate Schools </i>for two years in a row. John Marshall is the only law school in the Midwest to mandate experiential learning in order to graduate, and leads the nation in the number of credits that students take in practice-based courses and hands-on experience.</p>
