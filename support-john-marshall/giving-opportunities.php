					<h1 class="page-header">Giving Opportunities</h1>
					<p class="featured-text">The John Marshall Law School is fortunate to have a strong financial endowment, which sustains the institution. Strong as this endowment is, however, it must be perpetually grown and nurtured to ensure that the law school&rsquo;s potential for great achievement is never limited by a lack of resources.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-1">Establishing a Named Endowment</a></strong><br>
					Establishing a named endowment is an excellent way of helping to ensure that the law school&rsquo;s potential for providing excellence in legal education is not limited by a lack of resources.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-2">Contribute to an Existing Named Endowment</a></strong><br>
					John Marshall is the steward and beneficiary of many endowments that support our students. Donors may choose to contribute to these established endowments.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-3">Contribute to an Academic Program or Center for Excellence</a></strong><br>
					The John Marshall Law School has established many Academic Programs and Center for Excellence which are leaders in their respective fields. Making a gift to one of these programs or centers supports these initiatives.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-4">Memorials and Gifts in Tribute</a></strong><br>
					A memorial gift to The John Marshall law School is a thoughtful way to honor the memory of a friend, colleague or loved one, express sympathy, or provide a tribute for some other special occasion.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-5">Graduating Class Gift</a></strong><br>
					Each graduating class has the opportunity to make a meaningful donation as a Class Gift to The John Marshall Law School.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-6">Outright Gifts</a></strong><br>
					The simplest, most common means of giving to The John Marshall Law School is to make a gift of cash, securities or personal property.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-7">Make a Pledge</a></strong><br>
					A pledge is an excellent demonstration of your committment to helping John Marshall advance its mission of providing access and opportunity. Your pledge allows you to choose what specific initiative you would like to support, for how long, and at what dollar amount.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-8">Gifts of Appreciated Securities</a></strong><br>
					Your gift of appreciated securities, such as stocks , bonds, shares in a mutual fund, or securities that you have owned for more than 12 months, impact John Marshall and gives you a charitabe income tax deduction at full market value, without any capital gains taxes.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-9">Planned Gifts</a></strong><br>
					Strange as it may sound, a gift of &ldquo;startling significance&rdquo; often can be made at very low cost. It&rsquo;s just a matter of planning <em>what</em> to give, <em>how</em> to give and <em>when</em> to give.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="#opp-10">Cy Pres Award</a></strong><br>
					Cy Pres awards are residual funds in class action cases (and occasionally in other types of proceedings like bankruptcy and probate matters) that, for any number of reasons, are unclaimed or cannot be distributed to the class members or beneficiaries who were the intended recipients.</p>
