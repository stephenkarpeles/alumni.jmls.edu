					<h1 class="page-header">Graduating Class Gift</h1>					
					<p class="featured-text">Each graduating class has the opportunity to make a meaningful donation as a Class Gift to The John Marshall Law School.</p> 
					<p>Graduates are asked to give an amount equal to their graduation year. For example, $20.09 to represent 2009. Class members vote to designate what the "class gift" will support, such as the General Scholarship Fund.</p> 
					<p>Each donor to the Class Gift is recognized in The Annual Report of the Dean. This publication is sent to thousands of prominent and influential John Marshall alumni and friends; having your name on this list is a great way to garner recognition as a recent graduate while at the same time contributing to the success of the school.</p>
					<p>To contribute to the Graduating Class gift fund securely online, please <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/give" target="_blank"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
