					<h1 class="page-header">Contribute to an Academic Program</h1>					
					<p>Academic programs allow John Marshall students unique opportunities to learn legal topics in a real-world context, through innovative classes, conferences, lecture series, national and international moot court competitions, study abroad programs, and networking opportunities. Examples include:</p>			
					<ul>
						<li>Students in the China IP Summer Program studied real intellectual property issues in Chinese law at Peking University in Beijing, China.</li>
						<li>Real estate law students attending the Kratovil Conference focused on legal issues involving real estate and water useage.</li>
						<li>The Center for Advocacy and Dispute Resolution successfully prepares students for work in the real world with their mock trials and ADR competitions.</li>
					</ul>	
					<p>Your gift will allow expansion of these and other valuable programs, bringing leading scholars and practitioners to the law school to interact with our students. For example, in just the past two years, the school has added nine outstanding new faculty members to their academic programs resources.</p>
