					<h1 class="page-header">Gifts of Appreciated Securities</h1>					
					<p class="featured-text">Your gift of appreciated securities, such as stocks , bonds, shares in a mutual fund, or securities that you have owned for more than 12 months, impact John Marshall and gives you a charitabe income tax deduction at full market value, without any capital gains taxes.</p> 
					<p>In addition, you may be able to deduct up to 30 percent of your adjusted gross income in the year in which you make your gift, and carry-over an unused deduction for up to an additional five years.</p>
					<p><strong>How Do I Value My Stock?</strong><br>
					John Marshall values your gift of publicly-traded securities on the day it is received by the law school. The value of your gift will be the fair market value at the date of your gift.</p>
					<p><strong>Splitting Stock</strong><br>
					You can donate fewer shares of stock than the number printed on the stock certificate by requesting your broker to simply split the certificate, with a portion of the shares going to the law school as a tax-deductible donation, and the remainder certified by a new certificate.</p>
					<p><strong>Giving Closely Held Stock</strong><br>
					You can also give closely-held or restricted stock. Please contact the Development Office for more information.</p>
					<p><strong>Taxes</strong><br>
					A higher rate, close to ordinary income tax rates, is applied for property held less than a year. A lower rate, which is currently at 15%, is applied for property held more than a year. Please contact us to discuss your intentions further.</p>
					<p>To make a gift of appreciated securities, please contact a John Marshall Law School Development Office staff member by phone at 312.360.2663 or by email at <a href="mailto:development@jmls.edu"><strong>development@jmls.edu</strong></a>.</p>
