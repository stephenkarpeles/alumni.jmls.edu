					<h1 class="page-header">Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
					<p class="featured-text">Whether you want to mentor a student, coach a moot court team, speak on a career services panel, or attend the Student/Alumni Exchange, a few hours of time can have a transformative effect on tomorrow&rsquo;s graduates.</p>
					<h3>Student/Alumni Mentor Program</h3>
					<p>Mentor a John Marshall student. Each year the Office of Alumni Relations teams up with the Career Services Office to pair students with alumni. It all begins with a mentor/mentee kick-off event and we ask that alums meet with their student three more times throughout the spring semester. <a class="bold" href="http://www.jmls.edu/alumni-development/mentor-forms/alumni-mentor-form.php">Sign up to be a mentor</a>.</p>
					<h3>Student/Alumni Exchange </h3>
					<p>Network with students at the Student/Alumni Exchange. Students are advised that this is a networking reception, not a job fair.</p>
					<h3>Speak on a Career Services Panel</h3>
					<p>Help John Marshall students learn more about their various legal employment opportunities by speaking on Career Services Office (CSO)-hosted panels and programs throughout the year. If you are interested in speaking, email <a class="bold" href="mailto:alumni@jmls.edu">alumni@jmls.edu</a> for more details.</p>
					<h3>Mock Interviews</h3>
					<p>Help the CSO conduct mock interviews with students. You can even conduct the interviews from the comfort of your own office. Email Stacia Goldstein at <a class="bold" href="mailto:6goldste@jmls.edu">6goldste@jmls.edu</a> to volunteer. </p>
					<h3>Regional Representatives</h3>
					<p>Be a regional representative. Regional representatives are the first point of contact for the Office of Alumni Relations when we are scheduling events in your area, when someone needs a referral, when a student or alum is looking to move to the area, and other instances.</p>
					<h3>Career Alumni Network (CAN)</h3>
					<p>Offer advice to students relocating to your area. The Career Alumni Network connects students looking to relocate with alumni who work in their destination cities. When you sign up through CAN, we&rsquo;ll give your contact info to student looking for work in your city, so you can offer them advice and guidance as to what will make them more marketable in your area. <em>You will only be contacted by a student in those specific situations</em>. To join the Career Alumni Network, contact us at <a class="bold" href="mailto:alumni@jmls.edu">alumni@jmls.edu</a>.</p>
